#at present we only want facility-ids, air point emissions and the substances emitted, so let's select these

#we want to spread the data, but need to uniquely identify the rows first

#so let's only select columns if they have data

#we don't need dplyr's grouping anymore, so let's get rid of it to make things easier

#from here we can get summaries for different air emissions in the coal industry
#let's get the summary for acetaldehyde

  0%  25%  50%  75% 100%

#so the minimum emission over the past 3 years is 2.20kg and the maximum emission is 3.46kg

#the boxplot for acetaldehyde emissions
boxplot(dfp$Acetaldehyde, horizontal = TRUE)

#we should also calculate the number of observations these summaries are based on
acetaldehyde_obs <- (NROW(dfp$Acetaldehyde) - (sum(is.na(dfp$Acetaldehyde`))))

#from here we can create a similar summary of all air emissions in the coal industry
#future work would look at taking a functional approach to automate the work above
